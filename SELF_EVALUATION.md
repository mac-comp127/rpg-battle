## Self-Evaluation Rubric

# üî¥ Instructions

You can make a copy of this document and use the checkboxes below as you complete the self-evaluation of your solution.

# Correctness

Use the list below to evaluate the correctness of your solution. Cross off the items that your solution passes.

- [ ] The `GameCharacter` class mentions `Weapon` in four places:
  - [ ] an instance variable
  - [ ] a constructor parameter
  - [ ] a getter method
  - [ ] in the `attack` method, which calls `weapon.attack(‚Ä¶)`
- [ ] The `GameCharacter` class has no mentions of swords or fireballs anywhere:
  - [ ] not as part of the name of any instance variables
  - [ ] not in any parameters
  - [ ] not in the constructor or any of the methods
  - [ ] not in imports at the top
- [ ] The `GameCharacter` class no longer uses the `Random` class, and no longer has a `rand` instance variable. (This variable should move to `Sword`, the only class that needs it.)
- [ ] There is a `Weapon` interface with two methods: `getDescription` and `attack`.
- [ ] There are two classes named `Sword` and `Fireball`:
  - [ ] Both say implements `Weapon`.
  - [ ] Both have `getDescription` and `attack` methods.
  - [ ] Both have instance variables that do not have names that start with a ‚Äúfireball‚Äù or ‚Äúsword‚Äù prefix.
- [ ] `GameCharacterTest` says `new Fireball(15, 7)` on the line that creates the character `sally`, and `new Sword(5, 10)` on the line that creates `marvin`. The file has no other changes.
- [ ] The tests in `GameCharacterTest` all pass.
- [ ] The `Game` class successfully plays a game when you run it.

# Code Style

Use the list below to evaluate the adherence of your code to the [COMP127 Style Guide](https://f25.comp127.innig.net/resources/style-guide/). Cross off the items that your code satisfies.

- [ ] all classes are in packages
- [ ] package names start with a lowercase letter
- [ ] newly created Java files have a header comment with (a) author name, (b) brief description of class, and (c) acknowledgement, if appropriate
- [ ] identifier (variable and method) names are descriptive
- [ ] **variable** and **method** names are in lowerCamelCase (no CapitalizedNames,  names\_with\_underscores)
- [ ] **class** names are singular nouns
- [ ] **class** names are in UpperCamelCase
- [ ] all instance variables are **private**
- [ ] proper indentation:
  - [ ] opening curly braces (‚Äú{‚Äù) are at the end of the line
  - [ ] closing curly braces (‚Äú}‚Äù) are on their own line
  - [ ] the indentation of closing braces is the same as the indentation of the opening statements they match
  - [ ] lines are indented according to how deeply they are nested
- [ ] completed TODO comments are deleted
- [ ] extra blank lines are deleted
- [ ] unneeded commented lines of code are deleted
- [ ] print statements used for testing are deleted
